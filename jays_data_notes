Data work to do:

1) Additional Cleanup
- Remove redundant entries in faculty sheet (e.g. Susan Robinson)
-- look for matching strings for:
--- Position title
--- Faculty
--- Department
--- > idea: can we make a hash out of these three columns and then just compare hashes?
-- if more than one match still remains:
--- take the entry with mcmaster email
--- take the first of the remaining entries
- Think we can remove WORK/STUDY STUDENT entries

2)  


3) Potential issues:
- Randall Jackson has two "Lecturer" appointments
- Still lots of blanks in 'department' field -- are these getting dropped by the cleaning algorithm?
-- I think we may need to change the script so that it just adds missing items to the lookup table

4) Other questions:
- Some departments seem to have a 'director' listed
-- e.g. Ram Mishra is listed as the 'director'
- or maybe all departments use this designation
- take a look at Susan McCracken's entry -- duplicates but one lacks a Department designation

- Alison McQueen -- listed as director of 'school of the arts', but also professor in History
-- is School of the Arts something different than a department??
-- no, I don't think so -- I think it's the same thing

- People can have cross-appointments show up 
-- e.g. Christopher Myhr is SoTA and CSMM
--
